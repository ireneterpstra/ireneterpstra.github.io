I am a Master's Student at MIT focusing on large language modes and reinforcement learning. Graduating spring 2024. 

I am excited to be involved with projects that let me explore using machine learning for robotics systems and autonomous vehicle control.

In my free time time, I love making fun personal projects, climbing, dancing, and photography.
