<!-- ## Intrests -->

In my past projects, I have worked on developing automatic sensor calibration for an autonomous marine vessel 
as well as developed path planning algorithms for autonomous vessels in dynamic environments. 

Throughout my work in implementing autonomy, I have seen the problems that arise when deploying the algorithms 
in the real world. As a result, I am very interested in researching how to create more robust and 
interpretable autonomy pipelines.
